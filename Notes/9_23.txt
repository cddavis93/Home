Runs completed: 
small & huge page
aocc_flags - perf-snap, uarch
icc_flags - perf-snap, uarch

Not completed:
all runsa (will start those this evening)

with ICC vectorization shoots up to 93%
qmcpack becomes memory bound (DRAM bound)


use ICC going forward
still small/huge page comparisons and scaling studies
use the runsa vtune runs from Varun as well as the ones he will send shortly
figure out a walker count that approaces 32GB of memory usage
coral2_64GB.xml gets to 34GB of memory usage
changes walker count to 288 for 8 OMP Threads (36 walkers/OMP)
coral2_32GB.xml gets to 22GB of memory usage


Understand what calculations are being performed in qmcpack and what problem they are trying to solve

running Varun's vtune tests this evening
