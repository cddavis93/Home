Tuesday December 6 Notes

Calculations done from 8 threads, assuming 16 threads cuts instrs per thread in half

DMC per thread per step (32 total steps)
90 billion instr

VMC per thread per step (4 total steps)
87.5 billion instr


#############################################################
recompile aocc code with the new print statements for marking phases

collect instruction counts for each step of aocc build
and how many to skip for start of vmc/dmc

set up simnow build for aocc
run trace correlation for aocc
