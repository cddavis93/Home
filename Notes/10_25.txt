Tuesday October 25 Notes

cleaned up imix script and improved for scaling to N total threads

ran pintool using instr addr for VMC stepdummy()
no data was collected (2 threads/walkers)

afterwards, ran with 1 thread/walker yielding the same result

trying using addr for 
QMCUpdateBase::startBlock(int)
005a2090

using startBlock generated data
prefix.imix.8824.0.interval0

using DMC stepdummy did not produce results
