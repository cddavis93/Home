Monday October 10 Notes

emailed to Jakub about configuration for cpu trace

Need to work on the twiki page

DO:
1. Get access to CPUPerfTools git repository, see RWCBE Infrastructure twiki page if you don't have access to the repo.
2. Use TraceCorrelationMetrics (CPUPerftTools/PIN/source/tools/TraceCorrelationMetrics) pin tool from the repository. 
	See the Readme for instructions.

upon 'make' gives error for missing files
may need to write a new make.config
