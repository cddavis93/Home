Monday (it's) October 3rd Notes

AVX2 seems to yield identical results as avx512

For today:
how to get memory bandwidth with -collect memory-access
**use** -knob dram-bandwidth-limits=true

set up script for metrics from Varun:
for memory bandwidth, I think you can run vtune -collect memory-accessÂ analysis. You will have to figure out how to use it though.
For dispatch stalls, use UOPS_EXECUTED.STALL_CYCLES
This counts cycles during which no uops were dispatched from the Reservation Station (RS) per thread.
There is no breakdown information.
Another useful metric, INT_MISC.RECOVERY_CYCLES : 
	Core cycles the Resource allocator was stalled due to recovery from an 
	earlier branch misprediction or machine clear event
UOPS_ISSUED.STALL_CYCLES : Counts cycles during which the Resource Allocation Table (RAT)
	does not issue any Uops to the reservation station (RS) for the current thread
It would be nice to see timeseries (PTC - per thousand cycles) for these metrics.
PTC is similar to PTI, but the denominator is the cycles.
So you need to make sure that the CPU_CLK... metric is also collected.

CPU_CLK_UNHALTED.THREAD       Core cycles when the thread is not in halt state

**use this**CPU_CLK_UNHALTED.THREAD_ANY   Core cycles when at least one thread on the
                              physical core is not in halt state.



need to start putting together presentation slides for Friday

LUNCH

Difference between small/huge page for all metrics are not significantly different
Data in excel sheets
