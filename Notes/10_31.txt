Transfer qmcpack work to clakeopt

Building qmcpack:
lapack - cmake cant find the fortran compiler


============================
checking for python... no
checking for python2... /usr/bin/python2
checking for python version... 2.7
checking for python platform... linux2
checking for python script directory... ${prefix}/lib/python2.7/site-packages
checking for python extension module directory... ${exec_prefix}/lib64/python2.7/site-packages
checking for PYTHON... no
configure: error: Package requirements (python-2.7) were not met:

Package 'python-2.7', required by 'virtual:world', not found

Consider adjusting the PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable if you
installed software in a non-standard prefix.

Alternatively, you may set the environment variables PYTHON_CFLAGS
and PYTHON_LIBS to avoid the need to call pkg-config.
See the pkg-config man page for more details.

Configure script failed, check config.log for more info.

**I DONT UNDERSTAND THIS**
=======================================
python2.7 is installed
adjusted PKG_CONFIG_PATH to include /usr/bin/python2


so far anything that needs compiler specification is not working
