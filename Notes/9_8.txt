Thursday September 8 Notes

Morning:
QMCPACK requries xml as input
https://sdrbench.github.io/ QMCPACK dataset is a .f32 file type
when opened in notepad it is all chinese characters

also look into Time Limits (and .STOP) for QMCPACK
produces a clean stop to execution

will begin moving forward with coral2 dataset with vtune

ran performance-snapshot, will run hotspots and HPC Perf Char
vectorization = 3.4%

hotspots run works


was getting a "too many open files" error for hpc-performance ??
HPC run worked but needed to increase the soft file limit: ulimit -n 2048 was sufficient

working on creating a bash script for vtune runs
