Friday November 18 Notes

get DMC reuse distances
calculate spatial locality for dmc 
and reuse distances for VMC

Davis, Cory This disk has plenty of space to drop the memtrace on:
/proj/research_intr
I then submitted Varun's command to LSF which seemed to have plenty of temporary space.
I forgot what the space requirement is, but it was x times the memtrace required


Use lsf to get memory entropy run
command line provided by Travis

lsf_bsub -q regr_high -P occ-perf -G occ-perf -oo /dev/null -eo /dev/null -R "select[(type==RHEL7_64) && (csbatch)] rusage[mem=16384]" <MEMORY_ENTROPY_CMD_LINE>

working on transfering everything I need to the etx machine
