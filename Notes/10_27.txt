Thursday October 27 Notes

running with 1 thread/walker

instr addr 
QMCUpdateBase::startBlock(int)
005a2090

need to know how many times startBlock is used
will then use -ripoccurrence 5 to try to run for DMC

in the objdump file, dummy functions are never called by the VMC/DMC run functions

looking for alternate functions

startBlock provides data, but it's block not steps

set_step() doesn't appear in objdump

using startBlock:
running imix for 2 thread/walker
new data is 18772
19726

1 thread/walker
19147

using this need to collect VMC/DMC and then again for memtrace with temp/spat/mem entropy


alright good data runs will be sent to trace_results
21861 is 2 threads/walkers for VMC


should be able to at least run memtrace and get temp/spat/mem data with VMC runs
