Wednesday September 21 Notes

Morning:
Pulling data into the spreadsheet

Data notes:
Time is generally decreases with weak scaling down, but so does computational intensity.
Only the DTLB Store Overhead changes significantly with weak scaling

Strong scaling
performance data is very consistent
processing time increases according to the thread/walker ratio

will go through and recompile libraries and qmcpack
rebuilding lapack and fftw using tags for aocc and icc
rebuilt both libraries

rebuilt qmcpack for aocc
will rebuild icc tomorrow

sudo rights for /opt/tools seems to be gone?
could not run script to enable huge page

standard page run on aocc with updated flags tonight

Note: with coral2_16GB(?) it was using 11 GBs of memory
currently on a check it is only using 8 GBs
but only using 8 walkers
may need 16

aocc with flags 4 threads & 8 walkers
vectorization jumped to 73.5%
Packed SP FLOPS are almost exclusively 512-bit
Packed DF FLOPS are not as good, but still about 65% are 512-bit
