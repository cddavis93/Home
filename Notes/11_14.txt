Monday November 14 Notes

when itrace attaches the pid of qmcpack, the qmcpack run crashes

when trying to use pin to launch qmcpack, it doesn't seem to find the libraries even after sourcing


instr count will count across all threads but individually
sum all these and then use that number for instrs to skip

varun will provide the folder path
/opt/intel/pin-3.21.../source/tools/*Examples/...

the instr count to the start of VMC is about 244 billion for thread 0 and about 200-210 billion for the remaining threads

using 244000 million to skip instr
will check in the morning
