Wednesday October 12 Notes

trying to figure out how pintool works

Usage: pin [OPTION] [-t <tool> [<toolargs>]] -- <command line>

Noteable options:
-logfile  [default pin.log]
        The log file path and file name


takes significantly longer to run 

knobs to potentially use?
-print_interval
prints result files at a listed intervals

still waiting on run to finish, hope it's done by tomorrow
