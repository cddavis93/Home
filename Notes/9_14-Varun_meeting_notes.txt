White mountains in New Hampshire
Weston MA

Use transparent Huge Pages, no modification of application
page table walk(?)

use varying compilers for comparison
aocc, gcc/g++, icc/cipc

use vtune to check 
-huge page impact (Varun will have a script to enable)
-vectorization
-OMP thread count for scaling (1,2,4,8)
-collect tlb miss rates (need to check which test does that)

Use Twiki page to log results/information (use other pages for reference)

** Meeting Notes <2022-09-14 Wed>
   - Send a link to Cory about page translation (page table walk)
   - *AI for Varun*: Setup a script so that Cory and others can enable/disable THP with limited sudo permission
   - *AI for Cory*: Keep the qmcpack twiki page updated
   - Build steps:
     - qmcpack uses cmake
     - Used OpenMPI to build qmcpack
     - qmcpack uses BLAS and FFT library (e.g., OpenBLAS and FFTW)
   - *AI for Cory*: Build qmcpack
     - Do not use MPI (cmake -DQMC_MPI=0) - but confirm if this is the only thing required
     - Compile with AOCC (Look aocc.amd.com to find the latest version. Varun can install the latest version on phrygia if it is not already installed at /opt/AMD)
     - Compile with ICC
     - Compile with gcc
   - *AI for Cory*: find optimal configuration
     - Check vectorization using VTune
     - Check impact of transparent huge pages
       - measure overall performance difference (runtime)
       - measure DTLB miss rates using VTune or LIKWID
     - Do scaling study (number of OpenMP threads scale - 1, 2, 4, 8)
