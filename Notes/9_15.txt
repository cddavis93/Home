Thursday September 15 Notes

Finished building qmcpack_gcc

ran 1 run with vtune
vectorization is still very low but slightly higher
3.3% > .4%
and IPC is lower to about 2.0 (need to double check)

need to create excel spreadsheet for all the data

qmcpack_icc is building

need to make changes to script
add ability to read variables for:
-compiler
-run type
-OMP threads
-walker count (need to duplicate coral2.xml for various walker counts)
-action type (also include shorthand name for the directory)
-normal or huge page?

Then make a higherlevel bash script that will call the lower level script
Want to start getting comfortable with screen or tmux

LUNCH

may want to make the res_type done from a conditional from action_type
scripts are finished
if I can get Varun's huge page script I could add it
right now it should take about 24 to run everything (before huge page)
