Thursday September 29 Notes

Running qmcpack aocc w/flags
shows error
Illegal instruction (core dumped)

qmcpack worked with the examples, but quits when run with all coral xml files

rebuilt again, but same errors

ICC run - doing run for huge/small page comparison. 
32GB file now only showing 18GB of memory usage
64GB looks to use 33GB of memory

doing another rebuild of aocc with rznv2
will run tomorrow morning
