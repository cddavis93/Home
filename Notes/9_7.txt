Wednesday September 7 Notes

Morning:
Beginning to build QMCPACK
new dataset to run - CORAL-2 benchmark
https://confluence.amd.com/display/DCGPUHPCAPP/QMCPACK#QMCPACK-FOM(singleGCD)

building QMCPACK
need extra include directories
could not find BLAS, LAPACK, FFTW
those are found

create paths /local/bin/  and /local/include
-- create paths not needed

now needs BOOST path (and most likely HDF5)
Boost_INCLUDE_DIR

build looks good, have to reboot laptop because system updates :)

Afternoon:
test running qmcpack
qmcpack runs with the example data

not yet working with coral2_####.xml
dataset from https://sdrbench.github.io/ is not in xml format

used scp to transfer h5 files for coral2 from laptop to phrygia server

qmcpack looks to work with coral2 datasets now
didnt finish the run (was currently on ~100 minutes since start)
