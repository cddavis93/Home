Monday November 7 Notes

vmc/dmc memtrace has been generated for 8 threads 120 walkers
need to process that data for entropy/locality
very little data is shown for reuse distance using 8 threads


get hpctoolkit running on the VM
basetoolkit has been installed

hpckit install with online/offline/apt cannot connect to the server for download
wget doesnt even work with phrygia


So here is where I stand with everything right now.
metrics: I have them, but the VMC/DMC runs on 8 threads provide very little data, especially compared to 2 threads.
I know before pintool had not been used for multiple threads, so I'm not sure what side of the run the problems come from.

simnow: intel basekit is installed on the VM, but hpckit is not
The VM cannot connect to the server for the hpckit download. online/offline shell install scripts and apt manager are not connecting to their server.
Trying the same download on phyrgia yields the same failed results:
HTTP request sent, awaiting response... 403 Forbidden
2022-11-07 10:30:47 ERROR 403: Forbidden.

hpckit is installed
cmake install through apt is 3.10 but qmcpack requires 3.17
install through source, and use ./bootstrap leads to needing openssl install
needs "build-essential" leads to 403 error

when trying to run qmcpack: error while loading shared libraries
linking error that would exist when not sourcing icc (but icc is sourced here) wrong version of icc?

this confuses me so much, now build-essential and other dependencies are now working with apt install
installed openssl from source, but still getting "could not find openssl" with ./bootstrap
