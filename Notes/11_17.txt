Thursday November 17 Notes

More data is generated, VMC threads 0-3 memory entropy is generated
But not sure what the metric means

spatial distance is finished for all threads
processing that data now (morning)

mostly likely will not have many threads of data for DMC

will need to put dmc reuse distances together. waiting for thread 1 and 4 to finish
can currently calculate spatial locality metric from threads 0,1,4
dmc memory entropy are pulling the error - sort: write failed: /tmp/sortiYUMlA: No space left on device
this was on phrygia as well as clakeopt
