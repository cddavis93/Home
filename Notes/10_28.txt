Friday October 28 Notes

RWCBE Meeting Notes
initially wanted to do trace steps (smallest chunk of computation)
added dummy functions were compiled "inline"
instead used the startBlock function call, will provide a full block's computation
for VMC it doesnt matter (1 step per block), but DMC will be longer (16 steps per block)

pintool was not tested using -ripstart in conjunction with multithreaded application
getting instr mix worked for a single thread, but not for 2+ threads
Varun was able to fix that yesterday in the pintool source code

There are still some issues with the tool that we are actively working on and checking
I'm doing some more runs, and we will check that we can trust the data

==============================================================================
pintool looks to be all good to 
have imix data for VMC and DMC, will start getting memtrace 
add to concat scrpt to find total instruction count - done

memtrace is generated

Figuring out how the other metrics work
need to write bash script for running the other metrics
