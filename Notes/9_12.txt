Monday September 12 Notes

vtune does not like mpirun, I believe there are too many arguments for the normal command
not gonna worry about mpi

As walkers are the basic units of workload in QMC algorithms, they are loosely coupled and distributed across all the threads.
For this reason, the best strategy to run QMCPACK efficiently is to feed enough walkers to the available threads.

will start running with 8 OpenMP threads
export OMP_NUM_THREADS=8

Will play with the walker count (make it a multiple of the thread count)
Default walker count values:
coral2.xml - 42
coral2_16GB.xml - 44
coral2_32GB.xml - 126
coral2_64GB.xml - 290

changing coral2 walker count to 8
PERF_SNAPSHOT
recommends hotspot, hpc perf, and threading analysis
approx 23 min of runtime
logical/physical core utilization low: ~7.0 of 20/10 available
choosing to only use 8 cores, and need to eliminate the hyperthreading on phrygia (sudo access/Varun)
"true" core utilization should be ~7.0/8 for 87.5% utilization
IPC: 2.303
SP GFLOPS: 2.192
DP GFLOPS: 9.813
x87 GFLOPS: 0.001
Average CPU Frequency: 3.691 GHz


HOTSPOT


walker count to 16
recommends hotspot, hpc perf, and threading analysis
approx 41 min of runtime
logical/physical core utilization low: ~7.4 of 20/10 available
choosing to only use 8 cores, and need to eliminate the hyperthreading on phrygia (sudo access/Varun)
true core utilization should be ~7.4/8 for 92.3% utilization
IPC: 2.325
SP GFLOPS: 2.449
DP GFLOPS: 10.724
x87 GFLOPS: 0.000
Average CPU Frequency: 3.691 GHz


will run some more tests tomorrow, for walker 8/16
8: hpc perf, threading
16: hotspot, hpc perf, threading

should we try OMP threads in increments of 10?
this will match the CPU count on the machine
