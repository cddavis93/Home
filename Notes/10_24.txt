QMCUpdateBase::startBlock
looks to be the start of each processing block
determined by print statements, but this function does not appear on the perf report


working to find how steps are called
inside of EstimatorManagerBase::startBlock(int steps)
MyTime.restart() is called once.
Does not appear that "steps" is ever used 

these functions that take the step count as input, don't seem to be using the variable

VMC
a for loop for nBlocks
a nested for loop for nSteps

DMC
do-while loop for nBlocks
a nested for loop for nSteps

8 steps during VMC (4blocks/1step each & 2 threads)
32 steps during DMC (2blocks/16step each & 2 threads)
