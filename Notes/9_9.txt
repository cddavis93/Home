Friday September 9 Notes

began exclusive runs on phrygia, but somehow lost the data and qmcpack
building qmcpack again (should finish during lunch)
need to test with mpirun, then back through vtune

LUNCH

back in business with qmcpack
working to get it to run with mpirun (with however many threads it will allow)
the process gets killed at -n 10, 32, 42, 1024

how do I check for sure how many threads may be used?

running on -n 4 at the moment...

qmcpack w/mpirun is taking longer to run than the standard call

the run (mpi/qmc only) is not finishing
I killed it after running for ~2 hours, without calling mpirun it would finish in ~30 minutes
