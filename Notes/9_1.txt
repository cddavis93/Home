Thursday September 1 Notes

Some qmcpack dependencies are taken care of

libxml2 requires automake 1.16.3 to run properly
currently automake 1.16.3 is installed in /home/cordavis/bin/
when command is run it sources /usr/bin using version 1.15.1
need to figure out how to source a different folder for automake
can use bashrc? need to explore other options
