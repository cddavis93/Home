Wednesday November 16 Notes

made progress in generating VMC trace metric files
reuse distance takes approx  7 hours
spatial takes approx 4 hours
memory entropy takes approx 5 hours

going to start DMC now (10am), and hope I can show by friday morning
also decompressing memtrace files and compressing others as I go

use the following python scripts from trace correlation metrics
reuse_distance_cdf.py
spatial_locality_metric.py
memory_entropy.py

check them along the way when possible

currently checking memory entropy

also using clakeopt to process dmc threads 4-7
will help make  things quicker

VMC is through to threads 4 for reuse distance and memory addr
thread 6 for spatial
