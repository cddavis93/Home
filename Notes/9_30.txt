Friday September 30 Notes

Will run aocc with new flags
still produces Illegal Instruction ......

will look to compare avx512 to avx2 (256 bit instructions)
need to figure out what flags to use for avx2 build

ICC compiler flags
https://www.bu.edu/tech/support/research/software-and-programming/programming/compilers/intel-compiler-flags/

looks like I just need to change -xCORE-AVX512 to -xCORE-AVX2
built and will be tested after lunch

rebuilding aocc using updated compiler flags to align compatibility shown by :
https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000058341/processors/intel-xeon-processors.html

LUNCH

aocc build is running with qmcpack (znver2 and new flags)
not as efficient as icc

recompiled with znver3 and gives illegal instruction again

running icc-avx2 with small/huge page
will have data by monday
