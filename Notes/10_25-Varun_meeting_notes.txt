Varun meeting notes 10_25

confirm VMC resetRun() takes up a lot of time (and for DMC)

find program counter for the start of each block/step

find how many instructions are done prior to the for loop?


use the prgm counter in objdump for step dummy, no offset needed
use knobripstart with instr addr from objdump
set knobripinmainthread to 0 (default value)

test with pin tool, still using 2walker/2threads while confirming data is genuine

keep updating the twiki, add all the vtune data from ppt slides

start thinking about paper what structure would look like for topic discussion
taking trace and figure out where efficiency can be improved?
what are the microarchitectural bottlenecks??

collecting samples of iteration runs
samples represent full application behavior

** Meeting Notes <2022-10-25 Tue>
   - Identified the program counters for the loop iterations within the VMC and DMC phases
   - *TODO for Cory*: Update twiki
   - *TODO for Cory*: Collect metrics (instruction mix, spatial locality, temporal locality, and memory entropy) for VMC and DMC phases.
   - *TODO for Varun*:
     - Give access to Cory for clakeopt and provide instructions on how to use it
     - Point to Mohammad Samavatian jupyter notebooks for trace correlation
