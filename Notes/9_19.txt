Monday September 19 Notes

Didn't get any of the uarch-exploration runs
Will write a script to run this evening

AOCC 
OMP8 - perf-snap did not create the output.txt file ??
threading/hpc-perf did not finish its run ?? elapsed time of ~0.1s

OMP4 - 
threading/hpc-perf did not finish run? elapsed time of 0.18s
WTF???

OMP2 same runs arent producing data

None of the OMP8 runs produced an output.txt file ?? like wtf is happening??


ICC
OMP8 - no perfsnap
data came from the hpc-perf run
elapsed times have shown a range between 690-790 seconds


GCC
OMP8 - no perfsnap
data came from the hpc-perf run
Other runs look to be good

=======================================
need to run
uarch-exploration for all compilers and threads/walkers

needs performance-snapshot for all compilers on thread/walker ct 8

will rerun all aocc eventually

after these are run, will need to rerun with thp enabled
@ /opt/tools run sudo ./thp-on.sh or sudo ./thp-off.sh

go back through reports for time data on DMC and VMC
