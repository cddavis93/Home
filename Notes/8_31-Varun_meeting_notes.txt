QMCPack
1 - build qmcpack with sample dataset
2 - basic analysis
	using huge page
	with/without avx (vectorization) 512 or 256 bit instructions
	how does it scale? - do a scaling study

use conda for python versioning
also compile using a specific compiler

vtune (intel tool)
man (manual command for tool documentation in linux)

if IPC low, where are potential bottlenecks (memory - cache misses?)

   QMCPACK source code: https://github.com/QMCPACK/qmcpack
   Get a sample input from https://sdrbench.github.io/
   Some information about building QMCPACK (may be old): https://confluence.amd.com/display/SWTOOLCHAINS/Building+QMCPack+Using+AOCC

   *AI for Varun*
   - Create account for Cory (cordavis) on phrygia
   - Add Cory to the phrygia calendar

   *AI for Cory*
   - Download, build, and run QMCPACK with the sample dataset
   - Run performance analysis using VTune, which should already be installed on the machine
   - Marko Scrbak would be another good point of contact.
