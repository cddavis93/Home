11-29 Varun Meeting Notes

INFO
Have trace correlation metrics, but not quite all the memory entropy metrics
VMC needs thread 7
DMC needs threads 1-7
but entropy is consistent from thread to thread
tried using lsf, but it was killed because too much processing. trying to figure out how to request more

John asked about working set size
But unsure if spatial distance or reuse distance is used as input
so we chose to wait until you were back to ask

traces are mostly being generated, but not finishing the number of desired samples
VMC
first 42 samples are full 50mil instrs
after that a thread does not meet 50mil and starts dropping out
last thread ends at sample 51
does not reach the desired 75 samples
DMC
only does 1 sample, and doesn't reach 50mil instr in any of them

=======================================================================
working set size uses reuse distances with the script

set up script to count how many of the vmc traces are good

look at itrace source code (itrace.cpp and header files within the directory of itrace)
try to identify where we are allocating memory in the code
check if we are deallocating memory or not
either using new operator or malloc
uses delete to free memory or free method to deallocate


run pin tool with debug enabled (-d 1) (inside runITrace.sh) to enable debug logs
add "2>&1" between .xml and '|' to get stderr to stdout
run with DMC first

===================================================================
after trace files are good
generate trace correlation metrics with the trace files
